# Welcome to student-annual-grade
This is my first data analysis project. This project was created for the benefit of studying at the data science bootcamp.

## Project Description
The dataset in this project reports on the performance of students' math and portuguese scores at two Portuguese schools in 2014. All columns here are from students. Although the data is taken from 2 schools, there are no attributes that come from schools. So I combined the two datasets.

### Objective
Here I check and analyze the data before running modelling. The goal is to rank the factors that have the most affect on student performance in terms of their average scores over the three learning periods.
